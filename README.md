## Design
CarCar is an application designed to manage an automobile dealershipâ€™s inventory, sales, services, customers, and employees. The dealership is split into 3 microservices: inventory, sales, and services. These microservices are designed to provide a solid foundation for building a scalable and maintainable web application. While utilizing PostgreSQL for relational database management, Django and Python were used to build the back-end of this application and ReactJS was used for the front-end to create a smooth and responsive single-page application.

The inventory microservice is responsible for managing the inventory of vehicles in the system. It provides RESTful API endpoints for the Manufacturer, VehicleModel, and Automobile models to allow users to create, read, update, and delete any of those models.

The services microservice follows RESTful API standards to allows users to create new technicians, see the list of technicians, schedule service appointments for their vehicles, view upcoming appointments, view a history of service appointments, cancel appointments, mark appointments as completed, and see which users receive VIP treatment for servicing if the automobile was purchased from the company.This microservice periodically polls data from the Inventory API so that the data in Inventory is not manipulated or altered.

The sales microservice follows RESTful API standards to allows users to create a new customer, create a new sales person, view a list of all sales persons, view a list of sales records, create a new sales record from the available automobiles in the inventory, and view specific sales history of a sales person. This microservice also periodically polls data from the Inventory API so that the data in Inventory is not manipulated or altered.

## How to Run this Application
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install and run Docker by clicking [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
3. Cd into the project directory and run the following commands in VS Code or your terminal. Note: if you are on macOS, you will see a warning about an environment variable named OS being missing. You can safely ignore this warning.
     ```
     docker-volume create beta-data
     docker-compose build
     docker-compose up
     ```
4. Open Docker desktop and wait for Docker to build the images and containers. This could take up to 5 minutes or more.

## Service microservice
The service microservice was designed to have 3 models:
- `Technician`: contains `name` and `employee_number` properties to store technician employee information in the database.
- `Appointment`: contains `vin`, `customer_name`, `date_time`, `technician`, `reason`, `completed`, and `vip` properties to store appointment information in the database. The `vin` field is used to store the VIN number of the vehicle associated with the appointment. This is not a foreign key because it is not related to any other model in the database as customers who did not purchase cars from the dealership would be allowed to schedule appointments. The `technician` property is a foreign key to the `Technician` model as there can be many appointments for one technician. The `completed` and `vip` properties are used to keep track of the status of the appointment and whether the customer is a VIP or not. The VIP status of a customer will be determined by cross-referencing the VIN number of the vehicle with the inventory records of purchased vehicles.
- `AutomobileVO`: contains the `vin` and `import_href`. This model serves as a value object to periodically poll automobile data from the `inventory-api` and integrate it into the `service-api` database without modifying the `inventory-api` database. This enables the data to be used as needed within the `service-api` microservice.



## Sales microservice
The sales microservice was designed to have 4 models:
- `Customer`: contains `name`, `address`, and `phone_number` properties to store customer information in the database.
- `SalesPerson`: contains `name` and `employee_number` properties to store sales person employee information in the database.
- `SalesRecord`: contains a `sales_person` property as a foreign key to the `SalesPerson` model as there can be many sales records for one sales person. This model also contains a `customer` property as a foreign key to the `Customer` model because of the one to many relationship indicating that one customer can have many sales records. The `automobile` property is also a foreign key to the `AutomobileVO` model as one automobile can have many sales_records if sold more than once. Lastly, there is a `sales_price` property to keep track of the price the automobile was sold for.
- `AutomobileVO`: contains the `vin`, `import_href`, and `sold` properties. This model serves as a value object to periodically poll automobile data from the `inventory-api` and integrate it into the `sales-api` database without modifying the `inventory-api` database. This enables the data to be used as needed within the `sales-api` microservice.
